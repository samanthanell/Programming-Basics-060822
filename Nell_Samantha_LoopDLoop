//MVP Story: 

// A local fitness coach and mechanical engineer is building an IoT device that pops out a piece of candy every time a runner reaches 2 miles on a treadmill but stops giving candy out at mile 6. We're tasked with building the loop functionality to know when to give a piece of candy and when to stop. -->

// Step 1: Using comments in your VS Code, answer the following questions: 

// How do we know we need a loop here? Because we are going to give out candy at steady 2 mile increments for 3 repetition cycles, or loops
// What's the starting point of the loop? 0 miles
// When should the loop stop? 6 miles
// How will it know to stop? We can make i<=6, so it will stop at 6
// What's the incrementing for each iteration of the loop? 2 miles
// What variables do we need? Number of miles on treadmill
// NOTE --> the above list of questions is a great tool to help you break down building a loop. Moving forward, you will be expected to know to ask those questions on your own. 

// Step 2: Build out the loop.
for (var x = 2; x<=6 ; x+=2) {
    console.log ("Give out candy at mile " +  x)
    
}
// Step 3: Save and submit.

// Stretch Feature 1

// Create a new loop where the runner only gets a piece of candy at every 2 miles AND if they were going move than 5.5 miles per hour.?
